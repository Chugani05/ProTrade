### Description

**Pro Trade** is a Django-based API for managing football player transfers in the transfer market. It provides structured endpoints to handle teams, players, and transfer negotiations efficiently.

The API is populated with **synthetic data** generated using **Baker** and **Faker**, ensuring realistic but non-authentic player and team information. It is designed for development, testing, and simulation purposes without relying on real-world data.
